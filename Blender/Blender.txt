1. Introduction

5. Transforms

Challenge:

Start a new Blend file
Move the default cube 1m on the Z Axis.
Rotate the default cube 45 degrees on the Z Axis.
Make a Diamond by scaling by 2 on the Y Axis.
Play and think about when you might need to apply a transform.
Let me show you the end state...

6. Duplication

Challenge:

Make a simple object or scene with primitives.
Remember you can rotate scale and move.
Duplicate repeated items.
If you complete a simple object with ease, try something more challenging, straight away, like the well I showed you earlier.
...Block out a more complex scene.

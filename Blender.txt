1. Introduction

5. Transforms

Challenge:

Start a new Blend file
Move the default cube 1m on the Z Axis.
Rotate the default cube 45 degrees on the Z Axis.
Make a Diamond by scaling by 2 on the Y Axis.
Play and think about when you might need to apply a transform.
Let me show you the end state...

6. Duplication

Challenge:

Make a simple object or scene with primitives.
Remember you can rotate scale and move.
Duplicate repeated items.
If you complete a simple object with ease, try something more challenging, straight away, like the well I showed you earlier.
...Block out a more complex scene.

7. Your First Material

Challenge:

Colour your model.
Make at least 3 materials and apply them to your model.

8. Intro To Snapping

자석 표시

9. Camera Setup Moving Around Your Models

Challenge
Position the camera so that it frames your model well.
Fell free to alter your model or scene if they aren't quite right.
Remember you can move it again later!

10. A Basic 3 Point Light Setup

Challenge
Add lights to your scene.
Start with 3 point lighting.
Add additional lights if you like.
Experiment and have fun.

11. Outliner

12. Rendering Out Your Scene

14. Intro and Setup Final Challenge

15. Blender's Interface

19. Basic Modelling Concepts

Vertices or 1 Vertex

this can be connected together with lines or edges

three vertices connect to triangle -> polygon

flat surface -> face

material -> further textures

Challenge:

Create a simple wedge, with the dimensions:
x=2, y=4, z= 2, no overlapping vertices
Bonus:
Keep the origin at 0,0,0 and match the following:

21. Vertices, Edges And Faces

174. Section Intro - Furry Heads

175. Using Metaballs

Challenge:

Make A Bug!

- Using Metaballs, make some sort of bug or slug or caterpillar or similar.
- Use at least 2 types of Metaball.
- Use at least 1 negative Metaball (ie. to subtract the shape)

177. Basics Of Sculpting

Typical Organic Workflow

1. Block out your model (metaballls)
2. Convert to mesh
3. Sculpt to refine and add detail and to let the creative juices flow!
4. Retopologise if mesh is important for animation or texturing
5. UV Unwrap / map
6. Paint / Texture / Hair

178. Preparing To Sculpt A Head

Challenge:

Grab Some Reference Images

- Get an image for the front view and side view of a human head.
- Set them up on second monitor or in a separate window in Blender.

179. Sculpt The Head Shape

Challenge:

Shape Your Head
- Get the overall head shape as you want it
- Block out the nose
- Block out the eye sockets
- Block out the ears
- Block out the lips
- Shape the chin and jawline
- Don't add finer detail yet!

180. Sculpt The Eyes

Challenge:

Sculpt The Eyes

- Add a sphere, rotate it, position it and mirror it
- Sculpt over the eyeballs, then remove a strip to create eyelids
- Add creases and details to get your eye to "medium detail"
